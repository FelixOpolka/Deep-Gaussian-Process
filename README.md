# Deep-Gaussian-Process
ðŸ¤¿ Implementation of doubly stochastic deep Gaussian Process using [GPflow 2.0](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) and [TensorFlow 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

Heavily based on a previous implementation of [Doubly-Stochastic-DGP](https://github.com/ICL-SML/Doubly-Stochastic-DGP) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08933)
